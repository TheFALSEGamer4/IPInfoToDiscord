# IPInfoToDiscord
jQuery and Javascript script that send new users ip address to a discord webhook.

At the moment, you need to import a jQuery script which can be done by doing, "<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.4.1/jquery.min.js"></script>" Then you need to do "<script src="/path_to_script.js"></script>". This is currently a working version but more improvments will be made later, this version will stay as the master branch until a noticeably better version has been made. Thank you for your time reading and I hope it works for you and your website/project.
